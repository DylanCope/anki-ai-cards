# AGENTS.md — project conventions

Read by every loop iteration. Keep it short and current — this file and
PROGRESS.md are the only "memory" between iterations.

## Verification commands

- Backend tests: `cd backend && uv run pytest`
- Frontend build/lint: `cd frontend && npm run build && npm run lint`

## Conventions

- Language/stack: Python (`uv`, FastAPI, SQLModel, httpx, `anthropic` SDK) in
  `backend/`; Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind in `frontend/`.
- Commit style: one task per commit, imperative message, reference the PRD task number.
- Structure: `backend/app/{clients,agent,api,models.py}`, `backend/tests/`;
  `frontend/` standard Next.js App Router layout.
- All outbound HTTP (ElevenLabs, AnkiConnect, Google Docs, Anthropic) goes
  through `httpx`; tests mock it with `respx` (or mock the `anthropic` SDK
  client directly) — never hit real services from a test.
- Secrets are env vars only, documented in `.env.example`, never committed.
  See PRD.md Requirements for the full list.

## Known constraints

- Two distinct agents exist in this project: the Ralph loop (builds this
  code) and the inner agent (the runtime Claude tool-use agent this code
  implements, defined in `backend/app/agent/`). Don't conflate them.
- The loop must never attempt interactive OAuth consent, VNC logins to the
  headless Anki instance, or `fly deploy` — these are one-time or
  infrastructure-affecting steps Dylan runs manually. Prepare configs/docs
  for them, don't execute them.
- No test may make a real network call to Google, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, or
  AnkiConnect. Mock everything at the `httpx`/SDK-client boundary.
- The app is single-user: access is gated to one Google account via
  `ALLOWED_EMAIL`. Don't add multi-user/auth-provider abstractions.
- UI appearance/UX correctness can't be verified by the loop — flag it in
  PROGRESS.md for Dylan's manual review instead of claiming it "works."
- **Environment DNS bug:** this WSL2 sandbox's DNS proxy corrupts responses
  for some domains (e.g. `registry.npmjs.org`), causing `npm`/`npx`/`curl` to
  hang forever (glibc retries over TCP after a bad UDP answer; the proxy
  doesn't answer TCP DNS). Workaround already applied: a local CONNECT proxy
  at `~/.local/share/anki-ai-cards/connect_proxy.py` (does its own IPv4-only
  resolution) is registered in `~/.npmrc` as `proxy`/`https-proxy`. If `npm`
  commands hang again, run `~/.local/bin/ensure-npm-proxy.sh` to restart it —
  it's a background process that doesn't survive a VM restart. This is a
  sandbox quirk, not a project dependency; nothing to fix in the repo.
